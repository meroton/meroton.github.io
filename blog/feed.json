This can be used to ensure that all targets are rebuilt periodically even if they are accessed frequently enough to not normally be purged from the cache.</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV\" id=\"read-only-cache-replicas\">Read Only Cache Replicas<a class=\"hash-link\" href=\"#read-only-cache-replicas\" title=\"Direct link to heading\">​</a></h3><p>Cache read traffic can now be sent to a read-only replica which is periodically probed for availability.</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV\" id=\"concurrency-limiting-blob-replication\">Concurrency Limiting Blob Replication<a class=\"hash-link\" href=\"#concurrency-limiting-blob-replication\" title=\"Direct link to heading\">​</a></h3><p>Limit the number of concurrent replications to prevent network starvation</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV\" id=\"run-commands-as-another-user\">Run Commands as Another User<a class=\"hash-link\" href=\"#run-commands-as-another-user\" title=\"Direct link to heading\">​</a></h3><p>Allows the commands to be run as a different user, on most platforms this means the bb-runner instance must run as root.</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV\" id=\"size-class-analysis\">Size Class Analysis<a class=\"hash-link\" href=\"#size-class-analysis\" title=\"Direct link to heading\">​</a></h3><p>Allows executioners of different size classes to be used, the scheduler will attempt to utilize executioners efficiently but there is an inherent tradeof between throughput and latency. Once configured the scheduler will automatically attempt to keep track of which actions are best run on which executioners.</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV\" id=\"execution-routing-policy\">Execution Routing Policy<a class=\"hash-link\" href=\"#execution-routing-policy\" title=\"Direct link to heading\">​</a></h3><p>The scheduler accepts an execution routing policy configuration that allows it to determine how to defer builds to different executioners.</p><p>If you see any other changes you feel should get a mention feel free to submit a pull request at github usin the link below.</p>",
