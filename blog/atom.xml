        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When you have a remote build and cache cluster it can sometimes be hard to track down what exactly is using all of your building resources. To help with this we have started a tips and trix section in the documentation where we will share methods we use to debug and resolve slow builds.</p><p>The first section is about build non-determinism. Ideally your build actions should produce the same output when run with the same input, in practice this is sometimes not the case. If you are lucky a non-deterministic action won't be noticed since the inputs for the non-deterministic action is unchanged it won't be rebuilt.</p><p>If you're not so lucky the non-determinism stems from a bug in the implementation and you should definitiely pay attention to them. But how do you know which if any actions are non-deterministic?</p><p>This is not trivial but we have added <a href="/docs/tips/non-deterministic-builds/">a server side feature</a> which allows detection of non-determinism with virtually no effort on your part.</p><p>Once activated it reruns a configured fraction of your actions and automatically flags them if they produce different outputs. The scheduling is done outside of your bazel invocation so your build throughput will be unaffected at the cost of an increase in the number of resources consumed. We suggest 1% which will only increase your resource use by a trivial amount but you could of course set it to 100% which would double the cost of your builds.</p>]]></content>

As an aid for people to understand which changes have been done see the following high level summary.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="april-2022-updates">April 2022 Updates<a class="hash-link" href="#april-2022-updates" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>This includes updates to Buildbarn since December 2020.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="authorizer-overhaul">Authorizer Overhaul<a class="hash-link" href="#authorizer-overhaul" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Authorizers have been rehauled to be more flexible it is now part of each individual cache and execution configuration.</p><p>Using a JWT authorization bearer token has been added as an authorization method.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="hierarchical-blob-access">Hierarchical Blob Access<a class="hash-link" href="#hierarchical-blob-access" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Using hierarchical blob access allows blobs in instance name <code>foo/bar</code> to be accessed from instance <code>foo/bar/baz</code> but not instance <code>foo</code> or <code>foo/qux</code>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="action-result-expiration">Action Result Expiration<a class="hash-link" href="#action-result-expiration" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>An expiry can be added to action result which lets the action cache purge the result of an exection that was performed too far in the past. This can be used to ensure that all targets are rebuilt periodically even if they are accessed frequently enough to not normally be purged from the cache.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="read-only-cache-replicas">Read Only Cache Replicas<a class="hash-link" href="#read-only-cache-replicas" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Cache read traffic can now be sent to a read-only replica which is periodically probed for availability.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="concurrency-limiting-blob-replication">Concurrency Limiting Blob Replication<a class="hash-link" href="#concurrency-limiting-blob-replication" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Limit the number of concurrent replications to prevent network starvation</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="run-commands-as-another-user">Run Commands as Another User<a class="hash-link" href="#run-commands-as-another-user" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Allows the commands to be run as a different user, on most platforms this means the bb-runner instance must run as root.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="size-class-analysis">Size Class Analysis<a class="hash-link" href="#size-class-analysis" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Allows executioners of different size classes to be used, the scheduler will attempt to utilize executioners efficiently but there is an inherent tradeof between throughput and latency. Once configured the scheduler will automatically attempt to keep track of which actions are best run on which executioners.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="execution-routing-policy">Execution Routing Policy<a class="hash-link" href="#execution-routing-policy" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The scheduler accepts an execution routing policy configuration that allows it to determine how to defer builds to different executioners.</p><p>If you see any other changes you feel should get a mention feel free to submit a pull request at github using the link below.</p>]]></content>

It is not to serve as reference material, structured reference material should be available in the documentation section.</p><p>The article format allows more in depth on discussions for reacurring subjects. In contrast to the documentation published articles aren't changed, if the subject requires a revisit in the future then we publish a new post and add references to the old.</p><p>If you see any errors feel free to submit a pull request at github using the link below.</p>]]></content>
