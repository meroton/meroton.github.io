        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the Buildbarn event at Snowflake this week, Ed Schouten presented the work on
the <a href="https://github.com/buildbarn/bonanza" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bonanza project</a>. Bonanza is a prototype for a drop in replacement Bazel with
improvements to its communication protocols and written as a client that performs
all of its actions remotely, deduplicated and cacheable.</p>
<h1>How is it different from Bazel?</h1>
<p>Bazel is written in an interesting manner. It is designed from the ground up to
represent a stable description of a build that is reproducible from any
developer's machine. Any developer can check out the same source code ask Bazel
to analyze it and get the exact commands Bazel would run to perform the
build.</p>
<p>This involves a lot of computation: Resolving bazel modules, downloading
repository rules, executing them, analyzing the <code>.bzl</code> and <code>BUILD.bazel</code> files,
and finally executing the actions themselves.</p>
<p>Bazel internally represents these computation steps as pure functions returning
deterministic values from a stable key, internally represented as <code>SkyFunctions</code>
returning <code>SkyValues</code> from <code>SkyKeys</code>.</p>
<p>A <code>SkyFunction</code> should return the same <code>SkyValue</code> given the same <code>SkyKey</code> which
makes it a good candidate for being computed only once and have the result
cached and fed through to the next step. But peculiarly only the action
execution itself has been offloaded to remote cache and execution.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="cache all the things" src="https://meroton.github.io/assets/images/all_the_things-49c295edfd8fdfa47bb93be35ebfa40b.webp" width="842" height="998" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>This is what Bonanza attempts to resolve. Instead of having all of that state
computed and represented locally, repeated by each developer and discarded
whenever a flag changes, Bonanza is designed from the ground up to offload all
computations, downloads, and analysis to a remote cacheable system. This
essentially reduces the client side to a very light weight program with the
primary purpose of scanning the source code for modifications and uploading any
local changes.</p>
<h1>What's the current state?</h1>
<p>The project is still in an early state prototype state. In the presentation Ed
demonstrated how far the prototype has come, and it was very impressive. The
Bonanza client as of today is capable of analyzing the bb-storage codebase.</p>
<p>There is still a lot remaining before it's a production ready system but it is
very impressive progress. Bonanza is capable of running the full <code>bzlmod</code>
resolution, fetching all relevant repository rules from upstream, run those
repository rules, and analyzing the resulting codebase, basically performing
everything a Bazel <code>cquery</code> does, all with fully remote and cacheable manner.</p>
<p>For shops which lean heavily on remote caching and execution the remaining
local load is often the bottleneck for your builds, the ability to offload the
remaining pieces to your build cluster may be the next evolution of your build
system.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When running a remote cache and execution cluster based on Buildbarn the Key
Location Map (KLM) is a term that you will run into and it is important to take
proper care when sizing the KLM and the number of KLM attempts.</p>
<p>If you are just looking for a ballpark number to get you started, set the number
of get attempts to 16 and the number of put attempts to 64 and use the following
table.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th></th><th>CAS</th><th>AC</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Average Object Size</td><td>125KB</td><td>1KB</td></tr><tr><td>Storage Size</td><td>500TB</td><td>1GB</td></tr><tr><td>KLM Entries</td><td>16 000 000</td><td>4 000 000</td></tr><tr><td>KLM Size</td><td>1056MB</td><td>264MB</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>These are arbitrarily chosen values which are unlikely to match your actual
workload. I recommend reading the rest of the article to understand your
settings and how to reason about this. You can then use the prometheus metrics
in the end to validate if your settings are a good match for your workload.</p>
<h1>How does the KLM work?</h1>
<p>The KLM is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hash table</a> which
describes the position in your storage layer where your desired data is written
and is indexed by hashing the key of your storage data.</p>
<p>Given a limited key space hash functions will have collisions, it is therefore
important that the KLM is significantly larger than required for fitting a key
for every object. To keep the likelihood of a collision low a naive
implementation would require an enourmous hash table but using a technique
called Robin Hood hashing this requirement can be kept down to a small factor
larger than the size of the key set requirement.</p>
<p>For example, in a blobstore which can fit <code>n</code> objects and that has a KLM which
can fit <code>2n</code> entries every hash would have a 50% chance of corresponding to an
already occupied slot. With Robin Hood hashing we can repeat this process
multiple times by incrementing an attempts counter giving us multiple possible
locations for the same object.</p>
<p>When querying for an object we can then search up to the maximum number of
allowed iterations to find our object in one of these slots. When inserting we
perform a similar solution, namely incrementing the number of attempts whenever
we encounter a collision but taking care to insert the younger of the colliding
objects in the colliding slot and pushing the older object forward.</p>
<p>The number of attempts we allow the KLM to look for a free slot is described by
the two parameters <code>key_location_map_maximum_get_attempts</code> and the
<code>key_location_map_maximum_put_attempts</code> described by the
<a href="https://github.com/buildbarn/bb-storage/blob/0941111f29e31905e4081e6262bccf0c123940ed/pkg/proto/configuration/blobstore/blobstore.proto#L429" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>LocalBlobAccessConfiguration</code></a>.</p>
<h1>So, how big should the KLM be?</h1>
<p>Given a utilization rate <code>r</code> the chance of finding the object within <code>k</code>
iterations is <code>1-r^k</code>, we can therefore either decrease the utilization rate (by
increasing the size of the KLM) or increase the number of attempts.</p>
<p>Due to the random access nature of the KLM the KLM greatly benefits from being
small enough to fit in memory, even if the KLM itself is disk backed. Should the
KLM be too big to fit in memory it will be constantly paged in and out
detrimenting the system performance.</p>
<p>Simularly, there also needs to be a max number of iterations, in the degenerate
case where the storage fits more entries than the klm is capable of inserting is
full the algorithm would never terminate since every single slot would be
occupied.</p>
<p>Having a KLM that is too small for the number of iterations used is bad.</p>
<p>This is somewhat mitigated by the insertion order where the oldest entries get
pushed out first, since they are less likely to be relevant. This gives a
graceful degradation for when your KLM is too small. You should choose a KLM so
that the number of times you reach the maximum number of iterations is
acceptably low.</p>
<h1>How rare should you keep the maximum nuber of iterations?</h1>
<p>It should be rare, but most objects that get discarded due to the KLM being full
will tend to be old and unused. There is however a point where it is no longer
meaningful to have a larger KLM.</p>
<p>Ultimately, any time you read or write to a disk there is a risk of failure.
Popularly this is described as happening due to cosmic radiation but more
realistically it is due random hardware failures from imperfections in the
hardware.</p>
<p>Picking <code>k</code> and <code>r</code> values that gives a risk of dataloss below the Uncorrectable
Bit Error Rate (UBER) of a disk is simply wasteful, should you wish to reduce
the risk below this value you need to look at mirroring data.</p>
<p><a href="https://documents.westerndigital.com/content/dam/doc-library/en_us/assets/public/western-digital/product/internal-drives/wd-gold-ssd/product-brief-wd-gold-enterprise-class-nvme-ssd.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Western
Digital</a>
advertises that their Gold enterprise NVME disks has an UBER rate of 1 in 10^17,
i.e. about once per 10 petabytes of read data so will serve as a decent
standard.</p>
<p>For a random CAS object of 125KB this corresponds to a failure rate of about 1
in 10^11 reads, giving us this neat graph.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="diagram" src="https://meroton.github.io/assets/images/failure_rate-00397007b81f92d538f10370aeb9eb29.svg" width="605" height="340" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>That is, for a KLM using the recommended 16 iterations giving it more than 5
entries per object in the storage is a waste since you are just as likely to
fail to read the object due to disk errors as due to the KLM accidentally
pushing it out.</p>
<p>Similarly for 32 iterations there is no point in having more than 2 entries per
object, and for 8 iterations there is no point in having more than 20 entries
per object.</p>
<p>As for number of put iterations, just keep it at 4x the number of get
iterations. There is no fancy math here, it just needs to be bigger than the
number of get iterations and it is very cheap since you will only put objects a
miniscule fraction of the amount of times you will get objects.</p>
<p>The thought of data randomly getting lost might upset you spiritually, but you
can comfort yourself with that you are far more likely to lose due to AWS
engineer tripping on a cable in the datacenter.</p>
<h1>How do I verify if my KLMs are properly sized?</h1>
<p>Buildbarn exposes the behavior of the hashing strategy in it's Prometheus
metrics, they are exposed in the following metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>hashing_key_location_map_get_attempts</code></li>
<li><code>hashing_key_location_map_get_too_many_attempts_total</code></li>
<li><code>hashing_key_location_map_put_iterations</code></li>
<li><code>hashing_key_location_map_put_too_many_iterations_total</code></li>
</ul>
<p>These metrics exposes the required number of get and put attempts respectively
as well as how many times we exceeded the maximum number of iterations, you can
read the ratio between how many iterations were required to figure out how full
the klm is. I.e. if you perform half as many attempts with 2 iterations as with
1 iteration this implies the klm is half full.</p>
<p>There are ready made Grafana dashboards which visualizes these metrics in in
<a href="https://github.com/buildbarn/bb-deployments" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bb-deployments</a>.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you have a formatter tool
that can rewrite your code
you can run it automatically on all unmerged commits.
This will show you how to script <code>git-rebase</code>
to do so without any conflicts.</p>
<p>There are two ways to do it manually, forward or backward.
The forward pass amends each commit
and deals with the conflicts when stepping to the next commit.
In contrast the backwards pass, formats each commit from the end,
which will avoid conflicts but for long commit chains it can be almost as boring.</p>
<p>This pattern comes up when working with long-lived feature branches,
or tasks that were almost done, and then pre-empted by other prioritized work.
Here are a few oneliners you can run to tidy up your commits.</p>
<p>See also the full technical guide for developing this <code>git-rebase</code> workflow
in <a href="https://meroton.github.io/docs/practice/rebase-and-reformat-git-branches-automatically/">our documentation</a>.
Which contains more details on rebasing with <code>git</code>,
using a scriptable editor to automate the <code>git-rebase</code> todo-list,
as well as the squashed commit messages.</p>

<p>Say you have three unmerged commits:</p>
<p>21cc7b5 My amazing feature
e05fd9f Other complimentary work
acb9fae Fix annoying bug</p>
<p>They contain important work, but you forgot to run some linters,
or the main branch added more lint requirements
after the feature work was started.
This will run linters that can automatically fix issues on each commit
through a scripted <code>git-rebase</code>.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>2: Squash the fixup commit into the original feature commit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3: Squash the revert down into the next feature commit</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These tabs show how the commits evolve and are squashed,
the extra commits are grouped to indicate the target commit.
The revert of the first commit is grouped with the second feature commit,

<p><code>git</code> allows us to set any editor to edit the todo-list, <code>$GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR</code>,
and the commit message, <code>$EDITOR</code>.
We choose <code>vim</code> as it is often available, and easier to use than <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code>.
It is nice to have a <em>scriptable</em> interactive editor
to make changes to the workflow and try out the commands.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We have just started a documentation series
describing the Buildbarn <code>chroot</code> runners,
and how they can be used for hermetic input roots
that contain all the required tools.
This includes implementation notes for a "mountat" functionality
created through the new Linux mount API,
how you can use this under-documented API
and its shortcomings.
And how this <em>can/will be</em> integrated into Buildbarn,
with technical descriptions of the workers and runners.</p>

<a href="https://meroton.github.io/blog/bb-deployments-updates-2023-02/">previous update article</a>
and is a high level summary of what has happened in Buildbarn from 2023-02-16 to 2023-11-14.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="added-support-for-jwts-signed-with-rsa">Added support for JWTs signed with RSA<a href="https://meroton.github.io/blog/buildbarn-updates-2023-11/#added-support-for-jwts-signed-with-rsa" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Added support for JWTs signed with RSA" title="Direct link to Added support for JWTs signed with RSA">​</a></h2>
<p>Support for JWTs signed with RSA has been added.
The following JWT signing algorithms are now supported:</p>
<ul>
<li>HS256</li>
<li>HS384</li>
<li>HS512</li>
<li>RS256</li>

<p>Linux 6.2 added a sysfs attribute for toggling <code>BDI_CAP_STRICTLIMIT</code> on FUSE mounts.
If using the FUSE backed virtual file system on Linux 6.2
adding <code>{ "strict_limit": "0" }</code> to <code>linux_backing_dev_info_tunables</code>
will remove the <code>BDI_CAP_STRICTLIMIT</code> flag from the FUSE mount.</p>
<p>This may improve fileystem performance
especially when running build actions which
uses mmap'ed files extensively.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="add-support-for-injecting-xcode-environment-variables">Add support for injecting Xcode environment variables<a href="https://meroton.github.io/blog/buildbarn-updates-2023-11/#add-support-for-injecting-xcode-environment-variables" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Add support for injecting Xcode environment variables" title="Direct link to Add support for injecting Xcode environment variables">​</a></h2>
<p>Remote build with macOS may call into locally installed copies of Xcode.
The path to the local copy of Xcode may vary
and Bazel assumes that the remote execution service
is capable of processing Xcode specific environment variables.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/buildbarn/bb-remote-execution/blob/master/pkg/proto/configuration/bb_runner/bb_runner.proto#L133" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proto files</a> for details.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="add-a-minimum-timestamp-to-actionresultexpiringblobaccess">Add a minimum timestamp to ActionResultExpiringBlobAccess<a href="https://meroton.github.io/blog/buildbarn-updates-2023-11/#add-a-minimum-timestamp-to-actionresultexpiringblobaccess" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Add a minimum timestamp to ActionResultExpiringBlobAccess" title="Direct link to Add a minimum timestamp to ActionResultExpiringBlobAccess">​</a></h2>
<p>A misbehaving worker may polluted the action cache,
after fixing the misbehaving worker
we would rather not throw away the entire action cache.</p>
<p>A minimum timestamp in ActionResultExpiringBlobAccess
allows us to mark a timestamp in the past
before which the action should be considered invalid.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="add-authentication-to-http-servers">Add authentication to HTTP servers<a href="https://meroton.github.io/blog/buildbarn-updates-2023-11/#add-authentication-to-http-servers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Add authentication to HTTP servers" title="Direct link to Add authentication to HTTP servers">​</a></h2>
<p>Much like the gRPC servers are capable of authenticated configuration
the http servers can now also require authentication.</p>
<p>This allows the bb_browser and bb_scheduler UI
to authenticate access using OAuth2 without involving any other middleware.</p>
<p>This also allows us to add authorization configuration for administrative tasks
such as draining workers or killing of jobs.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="authentication-using-a-json-web-key-set">Authentication using a JSON Web Key Set<a href="https://meroton.github.io/blog/buildbarn-updates-2023-11/#authentication-using-a-json-web-key-set" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Authentication using a JSON Web Key Set" title="Direct link to Authentication using a JSON Web Key Set">​</a></h2>
<p>JSON Web Key Sets (JWKS) is a standard format
which allows us to specify multiple different encryption keys
that may have been used to sign our JWT authentication.</p>
<p>Buildbarn can load the JWKS specification,
either inline or as a file,
when specifying trusted encryption keys.</p>
<p>This allows us to have rotation with overlap of encryption keys.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>An adventure in finding a memory thief in Starlark-land</p>
<p>This is a summary and follow-up to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXimf4DCAoY#t=7h21m57s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my talk</a> at BazelCon-2023.
With abridged code examples, the full instructions are available <a href="https://github.com/meroton/memory-adventure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">together with the code</a>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="problem-statement">Problem Statement<a href="https://meroton.github.io/blog/memory-adventure/#problem-statement" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Problem Statement" title="Direct link to Problem Statement">​</a></h2>
<p>First, we lament Bazel's out-of-memory errors,
and point out that the often useful Starlark stacktrace does not always show up.
Some allocation errors just crash Bazel without giving and indication of which allocation failed.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="allocation" src="https://meroton.github.io/assets/images/memory-allocation-failure-298bf3c0d8e472754fd513fa6c0ce57d.png" width="1358" height="952" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>This diagram illustrates a common problem for memory errors,
the allocation that fails may not be the problem,
it is just the straw that breaks the camel's back.
And the real thief may already have allocated its memory.</p>
<p>We have seen many errors when working with clients,
and they typically hide in big corporate code bases.
Which complicates troubleshooting, discussion and error reporting.
So we create a synthetic repository to try to illustrate the problem,
and have something to discuss.
The code and instructions are available <a href="https://github.com/meroton/memory-adventure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>Errors and poor performance in the analysis phase
are not good at all.
This is because the analysis must always be done
before starting to build all actions.
With big projects the number of configuration to build for can be very large,
so one cannot rely on CI runners to build the same configuration over and over,
to retain the analysis cache.
Instead it is on the critical-path for all builds,
especially if the actions themselves are cached remotely.</p>
<p>To illustrate (some of the problem) we have a reproduction repository
with example code base with some Python and C programs.
To introduce memory problems, and make it a little more complex
we add two rules: one CPU intensive rule ("spinlock")
and one memory intensive aspect ("traverse").
The "traverse" aspect encodes the full dependency tree of all targets
and writes that to a file with <code>ctx.actions.write</code>.
So the allocations are tied to the Action object.</p>

<p>We have a couple of tools available, many are discussed in the <a href="https://bazel.build/rules/performance#memory-profiling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">memory optimization guide</a>,
but we find that some problems can slip through the cracks.</p>
<p>First off, there are the post-build analysis tools in bazel:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>bazel info</code></li>
<li><code>bazel dump --rules</code></li>
<li><code>bazel aquery --skyframe_state</code></li>
</ul>
<p>These are a good starting point and have served us well on many occasions.
But with this project they seem to miss some allocations
We will return to that later.
Additionally, these tool will not give any information if the Bazel server crashes.
You will need to increase the memory and run the same build again.</p>
<p>Then one can use Java tools to inspect what the JVM is doing:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://eclipse.dev/mat/documentation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eclipse Memory Analyzer</a></li>
<li><code>jmap</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The best approach here is to ask Bazel to save the heap if it crashes,
so it can be analyzed post-mortem: <code>bazel --heap_dump_on_oom</code></p>
<p>And lastly, use Bazel's profiling information:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>bazel --profile=profile.gz --generate_json_trace_profile --noslim_profile</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This contains structured information
and is written continuously to disk,
so if Bazel crashes we can still parse it,
we just need to discard partially truncated events.</p>

<p>As the two rules write their string allocations to output files
we get a clear picture of the expected RAM usage (or at least a lower bound).</p>

<p>First, there are some common rules that we do not care about here,
then we have the Aspects.
<code>traverse</code> is the memory intensive aspect,
which is applied on the command line
and <code>spinlock&lt;N&gt;</code> are the CPU intensive rules,
with identical implementations just numbered (there are 25 of them).</p>
<p>It is a little surprising that only one have allocations.
And the action count for each aspect does not make sense either,
as this is not a transitive aspect.
It just runs a single action each time the rule is instantiated.
The hypothesis is that this is a display problem,
with code shared between rules.
There are 25 rules, with 25 distinct implementation functions,
but they in turn call the same function with the action.
So the "count" and "actions" columns are glued together,
but the "bytes" is reported for just one of the rules (it would be bad if this was double-counted).</p>
<p>Either way,
the total number of bytes does not add up to what we expect.
Compare the output to the lower-bound determined before:</p>
<p>|  | Memory for each target | Total | Reported Total |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| Memory intensive | 0-17 MB | 79 MB | 262 kB
| CPU intensive | 136 KB |  3.4 MB | 524 kB</p>

<p>Here the Memory intensive aspect shows up with 256kB,
which is inline with the output from <code>bazel dump --rules</code>,
but not reflecting the big allocations we know it makes.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="eclipse-memory-analyzer">Eclipse Memory Analyzer<a href="https://meroton.github.io/blog/memory-adventure/#eclipse-memory-analyzer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Eclipse Memory Analyzer" title="Direct link to Eclipse Memory Analyzer">​</a></h3>
<p>The final tool we have investigated is the Java heap analysis tool
<a href="https://eclipse.dev/mat/documentation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eclipse Memory Analyzer</a>,
which can easily be used with Bazel's <code>--heap_dump_on_oom</code> flag.
On the other hand it is a little tricker to find a heap dump from a successful build.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="eclipse-analysis" src="https://meroton.github.io/assets/images/eclipse-memory-analyzer-5f46da77b0ac91a7a92dc4c2d3b445b3.png" width="1082" height="402" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Here we see the (very) big allocation clear as day,
but have no information of its provenance.</p>
<p>We have not found how to track this back to a Skylark function, Skyframe evaluator
or anything that could be cross-referenced with the profiling information.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="build-time">Build Time<a href="https://meroton.github.io/blog/memory-adventure/#build-time" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Build Time" title="Direct link to Build Time">​</a></h2>
<p>The next section of the talk shows the execution time of the build
with varying memory limits.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="combined" src="https://meroton.github.io/assets/images/build-time-memory-plot-39f61e675034b7e845f9abdbfa8951f4.png" width="640" height="480" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>This is benchmarked with 5 data points for each memory limit,
and the plot shows failure if there was at least one crash among the data points.
There is a region where the build starts to succeed more and more often, but sometimes crashes.
So the Crash and not-crash graphs overlap a little,
you want to have some leeway to avoid flaky builds from occasional out-of-memory crashes.</p>
<p>We see that the Skymeld graph requires a lot less memory than a regular build,
that is because our big allocations are all tied to Action objects.
Enabling Skymeld lets Bazel start executing Actions as soon as they are ready,
so the resident set of Action objects does not grow so large,
and the allocations can be freed much sooner.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="pessimization-with-limited-memory">Pessimization with limited memory<a href="https://meroton.github.io/blog/memory-adventure/#pessimization-with-limited-memory" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Pessimization with limited memory" title="Direct link to Pessimization with limited memory">​</a></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="pessimization" src="https://meroton.github.io/assets/images/low-memory-pessimization-667ab96247ad01ee0ec7d5b75b830d84.png" width="1212" height="827" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>We saw a hump in the build time for the Skymeld graph,
where the builds did succeed in the 300 - 400 MB range,
but the build speed gradually increased, reaching a plateau at around 500 MB.
This is a pattern we have seen before,
where more RAM, or more efficient rules can improve build performance.</p>
<p>This is probably because the memory pressure and the Java Garbage Collector
interferes with the Skyframe work.
See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Dc8R_Zrf6M&amp;t=3039s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Benjamin Peterson's great talk</a> about the Skyframe for more information.</p>

<p>This section details future work for more tools and signals
that we can find from Bazel's profile information
<code>--profile=profile.gz --generate_json_trace_profile --noslim_profile</code>.
Written in the standard <code>chrome://tracing</code> format
it is easy to parse for both successful and failed builds.</p>
<p>This contains events for the garbage collector,
and all executed Starlark functions.</p>
<p>These can be correlated
to find which functions are active during, or before, garbage collection events.
Additionally, one could collect this information for all failed builds,
and see if some functions are overrepresented
among the last active functions for each evaluator in the build.</p>]]></content>

<p>The largest blob you can store is the size of your your storage device
divided by the number of blocks in your device.</p>
<p>To store larger blobs,
either increase the size of your storage device
or decrease the number of blocks it is split into.
Larger storage devices will take more disk,
while fewer blocks will decrease the granularity which your cache works with.</p>

<p>To facilitate getting started bb-deployments emulates a block device by using an 8GiB large file.
This file is small enough to fit most builds while not taking over the disk completely from a developers machine.</p>
<p>The device is then split into 36 blocks (8+24+1+3),
where each block can then store a maximum of 238608384 bytes (8GiB / 36 - some alignment).</p>
<p>In production it is preferable to use a large raw block device for this purpose.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-does-newoldcurrentspare-mean">What does new/old/current/spare mean?<a href="https://meroton.github.io/blog/buildbarn-block-sizes/#what-does-newoldcurrentspare-mean" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What does new/old/current/spare mean?" title="Direct link to What does new/old/current/spare mean?">​</a></h2>
<p>In depth documentation about all the settings are available in the
<a href="https://github.com/buildbarn/bb-storage/blob/master/pkg/proto/configuration/blobstore/blobstore.proto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">configuration proto files</a>.</p>
<p>In essence the storage works as a ringbuffer where the assignment of each block is rotated.
Consider a 5 block configuration with 1 old, 2 current, 1 new and 1 spare block.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="diagram" src="https://meroton.github.io/assets/images/2023-04-11-buildbarn-block-size-1-15e36bcc18a3d4fcef69de02f8941f0e.svg" width="1190" height="559" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>As data is referenced from an old block
it gets written into a new block.
When the new block is full the role rotates.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="diagram" src="https://meroton.github.io/assets/images/2023-04-11-buildbarn-block-size-2-6e29080d339215d72c87cdd8a8a0000b.svg" width="1190" height="559" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>There are some tradeoffs in behaviour to consider when choosing your block layout. Fewer blocks will allow larger individual blobs at the cost of granularity. Here is a quick summary of the meaning of the different fields.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Old</strong> - Region where reads are actively copied over to new, too small value and your device behaves more like a FIFO than a LRU cache, too large and your device does a lot of uneccesary copying.</li>
<li><strong>Current</strong> - Stable region, should be the majority of your device.</li>
<li><strong>New</strong> - Region for writing new data to, must be 1 for AC and should be 1-4 for CAS. Having a couple of new blocks allows data to be better spread out over the device so as to not expire at the same time.</li>
<li><strong>Spare</strong> - Region for giving ongoing reads some time to finish before data starts getting overwritten.</li>

<a href="https://github.com/buildbarn/bb-deployments" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bb-deployments</a>
has gotten updates.</p>
<p>This is a continuation of the
<a href="https://meroton.github.io/blog/bb-deploy-updates-2022-04/">updates from last year article</a>
and is a high level summary of what has happened since April 2022 up to 2023-02-16.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="let-referenceexpandingblobaccess-support-gcs">Let ReferenceExpandingBlobAccess support GCS<a href="https://meroton.github.io/blog/bb-deployments-updates-2023-02/#let-referenceexpandingblobaccess-support-gcs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Let ReferenceExpandingBlobAccess support GCS" title="Direct link to Let ReferenceExpandingBlobAccess support GCS">​</a></h2>
<p>ReferenceExpandingBlobAccess already supports S3 so support was extended to Google Cloud Storage buckets.</p>

<p>Running workers with Fuse allows inputs for an action
to be downloaded on demand.
This significantly reduces the amount of data
that gets sent in order to run overspecified actions.
This however leads to poor performance for actions
which reads a lot of their inputs synchronously.</p>
<p>With the prefetcher most of these actions can be recognized
and data which is likely to be needed
can be downloaded ahead of time.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="support-for-sha256tree">Support for sha256tree<a href="https://meroton.github.io/blog/bb-deployments-updates-2023-02/#support-for-sha256tree" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Support for sha256tree" title="Direct link to Support for sha256tree">​</a></h2>
<p>Buildbarn has added support for
<a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/remote-apis/pull/235" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sha256tree</a>
which uses sha256 hashing over a tree structure similar to blake3.</p>
<p>This algorithm will allow large CAS objects to be chunked and decompositioned
with guaranteed data integrity while still using sha256 hardware instructions.</p>

<p>This change introduces a small change to the configuration schema. If you previous had this:</p>

are now postponed until the whole service is up and running.
Before, the healthy status was potentially reported before starting to listen to the gRPC ports.
Kubernetes will now wait until the service is up before forwarding connections to it.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="server-keepalive-parameter-options">Server keepalive parameter options<a href="https://meroton.github.io/blog/bb-deployments-updates-2023-02/#server-keepalive-parameter-options" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Server keepalive parameter options" title="Direct link to Server keepalive parameter options">​</a></h2>
<p>The option <code>buildbarn.configuration.grpc.ServerConfiguration.keepalive_parameters</code> can be used for L4 load balancing,
to control when to ask clients to reconnect.
For default values, see

<p>When <code>SIGTERM</code> or <code>SIGINT</code> is received, the <code>LocalBlobAccess</code> now synchronize data to disk before shutting down.
Deployments using persistent storage will no longer observe loss of data when restarting the <code>bb_storage</code> services.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="non-sector-aligned-writes-to-block-device">Non-sector Aligned Writes to Block Device<a href="https://meroton.github.io/blog/bb-deployments-updates-2023-02/#non-sector-aligned-writes-to-block-device" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Non-sector Aligned Writes to Block Device" title="Direct link to Non-sector Aligned Writes to Block Device">​</a></h2>
<p>Using sector aligned storage is wasteful for the action cache where the messages are typically very small.
Buildbarn can now fill all the gaps when writing, making storage more efficient.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="dag-shaped-blobaccess-configuration">DAG Shaped BlobAccess Configuration<a href="https://meroton.github.io/blog/bb-deployments-updates-2023-02/#dag-shaped-blobaccess-configuration" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to DAG Shaped BlobAccess Configuration" title="Direct link to DAG Shaped BlobAccess Configuration">​</a></h2>
<p>Instead of a tree shaped BlobAccess configuration, the <code>with_labels</code> notation allows a directed acyclic graph.

<p>The <code>bb_worker</code> can now supply the working directory for <code>bb_runner</code> using NFSv4.
Previously, FUSE and hard linking files from the worker cache were the only two options.
This addition was mainly done to overcome the poor FUSE support on macOS.</p>
<p>The NFSv4 server in <code>bb_worker</code> only supports macOS at the moment.
No effort has been spent to write custom mount logic for other systems yet.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="specify-forwardmetadata-with-a-jmespath">Specify <code>forwardMetadata</code> with a JMESPath<a href="https://meroton.github.io/blog/bb-deployments-updates-2023-02/#specify-forwardmetadata-with-a-jmespath" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to specify-forwardmetadata-with-a-jmespath" title="Direct link to specify-forwardmetadata-with-a-jmespath">​</a></h2>
<p>Metadata forwarding is now more flexible, the JMESPath expressions can for example add authorization result data.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[_ UPDATE:  Bazel has a workaround for this issue]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>** UPDATE: ** Bazel has a workaround for this issue
preventing the permanent build failure loop from 6.1.0 and
a proper fix with the introduction of
<a href="https://bazel.build/reference/command-line-reference#flag--experimental_remote_cache_ttl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>--experimental_remote_cache_ttl</code></a>
in Bazel 7</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Starting from v6.0.0, Bazel crashes when building without the bytes.
Because it sets <code>--experimental_action_cache_store_output_metadata</code>
when using <code>--remote_download_minimal</code> or <code>--remote_download_toplevel</code>.</p>
<p>Effectively this leads to Bazel getting stuck in a build failure loop
when your remote cache evicts an item you need from the cache.</p>

<p>The key here is <strong>(Exit 34): xx errors during bulk transfer</strong>.
34 is Bazel's error code for Remote Error.</p>
<p>The recommended solution is to set the flag explicitly to false,
with <code>--experimental_action_cache_store_output_metadata=false</code>.
To quickly solve the issue on your local machine you can run <code>bazel clean</code>.
However, this will just push the error into the future.</p>
<p>The bug is independent of which remote cache system you use
and is tracked at <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/17366" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="background">Background<a href="https://meroton.github.io/blog/bazel-6-errors-build-without-the-bytes/#background" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Background" title="Direct link to Background">​</a></h2>
<p>When performing an analysis of what to build
Bazel will ask the remote cache which items have already been built.
Bazel will only schedule build actions for items
that do not already exist in the cache.
If running a build without the bytes<sup><a href="https://meroton.github.io/blog/bazel-6-errors-build-without-the-bytes/#user-content-fn-1-13c049" id="user-content-fnref-1-13c049" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>
the intermediary results will not be downloaded to the client.</p>
<p>Should the cached items be evicted
then Bazel will run into an unrecoverable error.
It wants the remote system to perform an action using inputs from the cache,
but they have disappeared.
And Bazel can not upload them,
as they were never downloaded to the client.
The build would then dutifully crash
(some work has been put into trying to
<a href="https://groups.google.com/g/bazel-dev/c/WwNN4kiYSpc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">resolve this on the bazel side</a>
but it has not been considered a priority).</p>
<p>This puts an implicit requirement on the remote cache implementation.
Artifacts need to be saved for as long as Bazel needs them.
The problem here is that this is an undefined period of time.
Bazel will not proactively check if the item still exists,
nor in any other manner inform the cache that
it will need the item in the future.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="before-v600">Before v6.0.0<a href="https://meroton.github.io/blog/bazel-6-errors-build-without-the-bytes/#before-v600" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Before v6.0.0" title="Direct link to Before v6.0.0">​</a></h2>
<p>Bazel tied the lifetime of which items already exists in the cache
(the existence cache)
to the analysis cache.
Whenever the analysis cache was purged it would also drop the existence cache.</p>
<p>The analysis cache is purged quite frequently.
It would therefore be rare in practice,
that the existence cache would be out of date.
Furthermore, since the existence cache was an in-memory cache,
Bazel crashing would forcefully evict the existence cache.
Thereby fixing the issue.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="after-v600">After v6.0.0<a href="https://meroton.github.io/blog/bazel-6-errors-build-without-the-bytes/#after-v600" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to After v6.0.0" title="Direct link to After v6.0.0">​</a></h2>
<p>With the
<code>--experimental_action_cache_store_output_metadata</code> flag enabled by default
the existence cache is instead committed to disk and
never dropped during normal operation.</p>
<p>This means two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The implied requirement on the remote cache is effectively infinite.</li>
<li>Should this requirement not be met the build will fail.
And since the existence cache is committed to disk Bazel will just
fail again the next time you run it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Currently the only user-facing way of purging the existence cache
is to run <code>bazel clean</code>.
Which is generally considered an anti-pattern.</p>
<p>If you are using the <a href="https://github.com/buildbarn/bb-clientd#-to-perform-remote-builds-without-the-bytes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bb-clientd</a> <code>--remote_output_service</code>
to run builds without the bytes
(an alternative strategy to <code>--remote_download_minimal</code>)
this will not affect you.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We've performed some updates to the free tier and our pricing model.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="shared-cache">Shared Cache<a href="https://meroton.github.io/blog/remote-executors-for-free-tier/#shared-cache" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Shared Cache" title="Direct link to Shared Cache">​</a></h2>
<p>The free tier has been upgraded into an environment with a 1TB cache.
This means that you can use the free tier without worrying about hitting any limits or setup process.</p>
<p>Do note that while the cached items will only be accessible with the correct api keys,
the storage area can be reclaimed by anyone.
I.e. as the cache becomes full your items might be dropped.</p>
<p>With the current churn we expect any items in the cache last at least a week.
However, you should always treat items in the cache as something which might be dropped at any moment.
The purpose and design of the cache is to maximize build performance, not to provide storage.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="shared-executors">Shared executors<a href="https://meroton.github.io/blog/remote-executors-for-free-tier/#shared-executors" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Shared executors" title="Direct link to Shared executors">​</a></h2>
<p>New for the free environment is the introduction of remote execution,
this was previously only available for paying customers.</p>
<p>If you're using bazel you can simply add the <code>--remote_executor=&lt;...&gt;</code> flag and your builds will be done remotely.</p>
<p>The free environment has access to 64 shared executors.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="starter-tier">Starter tier<a href="https://meroton.github.io/blog/remote-executors-for-free-tier/#starter-tier" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Starter tier" title="Direct link to Starter tier">​</a></h2>
<p>If you need dedicated storage for evaluation purposes we also offer a starter tier.
The starter tier is a streamlined environment with 100 GB of dedicated cache and access to the same 64 executors as the free tier.</p>
<p>This allows you to try out remote execution and caching without being disturbed by others.
While the 100GB dedicated cache will only be used by you and therefore not be overwritten by anyone else's build,
the cache is still a cache and the system will still drop the cache entries if it determines it is useful for maximizing performance.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="need-more-executors">Need more executors?<a href="https://meroton.github.io/blog/remote-executors-for-free-tier/#need-more-executors" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Need more executors?" title="Direct link to Need more executors?">​</a></h2>
<p>At the moment the starter tier has a fixed amount of shared executors.
If you need a scalable solution contact us for setting up a custom Buildbarn environment of any size.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When you have a remote build and cache cluster it can sometimes be hard to track down what exactly is using all of your building resources. To help with this we have started a tips and trix section in the documentation where we will share methods we use to debug and resolve slow builds.</p>
<p>The first section is about build non-determinism. Ideally your build actions should produce the same output when run with the same input, in practice this is sometimes not the case. If you are lucky a non-deterministic action won't be noticed since the inputs for the non-deterministic action is unchanged it won't be rebuilt.</p>
<p>If you're not so lucky the non-determinism stems from a bug in the implementation and you should definitely pay attention to them. But how do you know which if any actions are non-deterministic?</p>
<p>This is not trivial but we have added <a href="https://meroton.github.io/docs/tips/non-deterministic-builds/">a server side feature</a> which allows detection of non-determinism with virtually no effort on your part.</p>
<p>Once activated it reruns a configured fraction of your actions and automatically flags them if they produce different outputs. The scheduling is done outside of your bazel invocation so your build throughput will be unaffected at the cost of an increase in the number of resources consumed. We suggest 1% which will only increase your resource use by a trivial amount but you could of course set it to 100% which would double the cost of your builds.</p>]]></content>

<p>Using hierarchical blob access allows blobs in instance name <code>foo/bar</code> to be accessed from instance <code>foo/bar/baz</code> but not instance <code>foo</code> or <code>foo/qux</code>.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="action-result-expiration">Action Result Expiration<a href="https://meroton.github.io/blog/bb-deploy-updates-2022-04/#action-result-expiration" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Action Result Expiration" title="Direct link to Action Result Expiration">​</a></h3>
<p>An expiry can be added to action result which lets the action cache purge the result of an exection that was performed too far in the past. This can be used to ensure that all targets are rebuilt periodically even if they are accessed frequently enough to not normally be purged from the cache.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="read-only-cache-replicas">Read Only Cache Replicas<a href="https://meroton.github.io/blog/bb-deploy-updates-2022-04/#read-only-cache-replicas" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Read Only Cache Replicas" title="Direct link to Read Only Cache Replicas">​</a></h3>
<p>Cache read traffic can now be sent to a read-only replica which is periodically probed for availability.</p>

<p>Limit the number of concurrent replications to prevent network starvation</p>

<p>Allows the commands to be run as a different user, on most platforms this means the bb-runner instance must run as root.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="size-class-analysis">Size Class Analysis<a href="https://meroton.github.io/blog/bb-deploy-updates-2022-04/#size-class-analysis" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Size Class Analysis" title="Direct link to Size Class Analysis">​</a></h3>
<p>Allows executors of different size classes to be used, the scheduler will attempt to utilize executors efficiently but there is an inherent tradeof between throughput and latency. Once configured the scheduler will automatically attempt to keep track of which actions are best run on which executors.</p>

<p>The scheduler accepts an execution routing policy configuration that allows it to determine how to defer builds to different executors.</p>

It is not to serve as reference material, structured reference material should be available in the documentation section.</p>
<p>The article format allows more in depth on discussions for reacurring subjects. In contrast to the documentation published articles aren't changed, if the subject requires a revisit in the future then we publish a new post and add references to the old.</p>
