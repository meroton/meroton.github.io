For that purpose we're inviting everyone in the wider bazel community to an open BuildBar at the Meroton offices.</p><p>Come over and digest BazelCon with high level technical discussions of the talks,
great company, a pleasant atmosphere and also beer.</p><p>Feel welcome to come over this Thursday the first of December from 16 to 20.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="directions">Directions<a href="#directions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Directions" title="Direct link to Directions">​</a></h2><p>You'll find us at our Linköping offices at Fridtunagatan 33. Currently there is some construction but follow the red lines and you'll be fine.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" alt="" src="/img/office_map.webp" class="img_ev3q"><figcaption>Fridtunagatan 33 Linköping</figcaption></figure>]]></content>

This means that you can use the free tier without worrying about hitting any limits or setup process.</p><p>Do note that while the cached items will only be accessible with the correct api keys,
the storage area can be reclaimed by anyone.
I.e. as the cache becomes full your items might be dropped.</p><p>With the current churn we expect any items in the cache last at least a week.
However, you should always treat items in the cache as something which might be dropped at any moment.
The purpose and design of the cache is to maximize build performance, not to provide storage.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="shared-executors">Shared executors<a href="#shared-executors" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Shared executors" title="Direct link to Shared executors">​</a></h2><p>New for the free environment is the introduction of remote execution,
this was previously only available for paying customers.</p><p>If you're using bazel you can simply add the <code>--remote_executor=&lt;...&gt;</code> flag and your builds will be done remotely.</p><p>The free environment has access to 64 shared executors.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="starter-tier">Starter tier<a href="#starter-tier" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Starter tier" title="Direct link to Starter tier">​</a></h2><p>If you need dedicated storage for evaluation purposes we also offer a starter tier.
The starter tier is a streamlined environment with 100 GB of dedicated cache and access to the same 64 executors as the free tier.</p><p>This allows you to try out remote execution and caching without being disturbed by others.
While the 100GB dedicated cache will only be used by you and therefore not be overwritten by anyone else's build,
the cache is still a cache and the system will still drop the cache entries if it determines it is useful for maximizing performance.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="need-more-executors">Need more executors?<a href="#need-more-executors" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Need more executors?" title="Direct link to Need more executors?">​</a></h2><p>At the moment the starter tier has a fixed amount of shared executors.
If you need a scalable solution contact us for setting up a custom Buildbarn environment of any size.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When you have a remote build and cache cluster it can sometimes be hard to track down what exactly is using all of your building resources. To help with this we have started a tips and trix section in the documentation where we will share methods we use to debug and resolve slow builds.</p><p>The first section is about build non-determinism. Ideally your build actions should produce the same output when run with the same input, in practice this is sometimes not the case. If you are lucky a non-deterministic action won't be noticed since the inputs for the non-deterministic action is unchanged it won't be rebuilt.</p><p>If you're not so lucky the non-determinism stems from a bug in the implementation and you should definitiely pay attention to them. But how do you know which if any actions are non-deterministic?</p><p>This is not trivial but we have added <a href="/docs/tips/non-deterministic-builds/">a server side feature</a> which allows detection of non-determinism with virtually no effort on your part.</p><p>Once activated it reruns a configured fraction of your actions and automatically flags them if they produce different outputs. The scheduling is done outside of your bazel invocation so your build throughput will be unaffected at the cost of an increase in the number of resources consumed. We suggest 1% which will only increase your resource use by a trivial amount but you could of course set it to 100% which would double the cost of your builds.</p>]]></content>
