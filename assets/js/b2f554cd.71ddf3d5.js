To help with this we have started a tips and trix section in the documentation where we will share methods we use to debug and resolve slow builds.\\n\\nThe first section is about build non-determinism. Ideally your build actions should produce the same output when run with the same input, in practice this is sometimes not the case. If you are lucky a non-deterministic action won\'t be noticed since the inputs for the non-deterministic action is unchanged it won\'t be rebuilt.\\n\\nIf you\'re not so lucky the non-determinism stems from a bug in the implementation and you should definitiely pay attention to them. But how do you know which if any actions are non-deterministic?\\n\\nThis is not trivial but we have added [a server side feature](/docs/tips/non-deterministic-builds) which allows detection of non-determinism with virtually no effort on your part.\\n\\nOnce activated it reruns a configured fraction of your actions and automatically flags them if they produce different outputs. The scheduling is done outside of your bazel invocation so your build throughput will be unaffected at the cost of an increase in the number of resources consumed. We suggest 1% which will only increase your resource use by a trivial amount but you could of course set it to 100% which would double the cost of your builds."},{"id":"bb-deploy-updates-2022-04","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/bb-deploy-updates-2022-04","editUrl":"https://github.com/meroton/docs/edit/main/blog/2022-05-04-updates-to-bb-deploy.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2022-05-04-updates-to-bb-deploy.mdx","title":"Updates to Buildbarn deployment repo","description":"The sample configuration project for Buildbarn was recently updated after a long hiatus.

As an aid for people to understand which changes have been done see the following high level summary.\\n\\n## April 2022 Updates\\n\\nThis includes updates to Buildbarn since December 2020.\\n\\n### Authorizer Overhaul\\n\\nAuthorizers have been rehauled to be more flexible it is now part of each individual cache and execution configuration.\\n\\nUsing a JWT authorization bearer token has been added as an authorization method.\\n\\n### Hierarchical Blob Access\\n\\nUsing hierarchical blob access allows blobs in instance name `foo/bar` to be accessed from instance `foo/bar/baz` but not instance `foo` or `foo/qux`.\\n\\n### Action Result Expiration\\n\\nAn expiry can be added to action result which lets the action cache purge the result of an exection that was performed too far in the past. This can be used to ensure that all targets are rebuilt periodically even if they are accessed frequently enough to not normally be purged from the cache.\\n\\n### Read Only Cache Replicas\\n\\nCache read traffic can now be sent to a read-only replica which is periodically probed for availability.\\n\\n### Concurrency Limiting Blob Replication\\n\\nLimit the number of concurrent replications to prevent network starvation\\n\\n### Run Commands as Another User\\n\\nAllows the commands to be run as a different user, on most platforms this means the bb-runner instance must run as root.\\n\\n### Size Class Analysis\\n\\nAllows executors of different size classes to be used, the scheduler will attempt to utilize executors efficiently but there is an inherent tradeof between throughput and latency. Once configured the scheduler will automatically attempt to keep track of which actions are best run on which executors.\\n\\n### Execution Routing Policy\\n\\nThe scheduler accepts an execution routing policy configuration that allows it to determine how to defer builds to different executors.\\n\\nIf you see any other changes you feel should get a mention feel free to submit a pull request at github using the link below."},{"id":"about","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/about","editUrl":"https://github.com/meroton/docs/edit/main/blog/2022-02-22-about.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2022-02-22-about.mdx","title":"Purpose of the Articles","description":"The purpose of these articles is to have a freeform area discussing ideas, technical issues, solutions and news in an indepth relaxed manner.
