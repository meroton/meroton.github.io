Fewer blocks will allow larger individual blobs at the cost of granularity. Here is a quick summary of the meaning of the different fields.\\n\\n* **Old** - Region where reads are actively copied over to new, too small value and your device behaves more like a FIFO than a LRU cache, too large and your device does a lot of uneccesary copying.\\n* **Current** - Stable region, should be the majority of your device.\\n* **New** - Region for writing new data to, must be 1 for AC and should be 1-4 for CAS. Having a couple of new blocks allows data to be better spread out over the device so as to not expire at the same time.\\n* **Spare** - Region for giving ongoing reads some time to finish before data starts getting overwritten."},{"id":"bb-deployments-updates-2023-02","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/bb-deployments-updates-2023-02","editUrl":"https://github.com/meroton/docs/edit/main/blog/2023-02-21-updates-to-bb-deployments.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2023-02-21-updates-to-bb-deployments.mdx","title":"Updates to Buildbarn deployment repo as of Febuary 2023","description":"The example configuration project for buildbarn","date":"2023-02-21T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 21, 2023","tags":[{"label":"release","permalink":"/blog/tags/release"},{"label":"buildbarn","permalink":"/blog/tags/buildbarn"}],"readingTime":3.375,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Benjamin Ingberg","imageURL":"/img/benjamin-avatar.png","key":"benjamin"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"bb-deployments-updates-2023-02","title":"Updates to Buildbarn deployment repo as of Febuary 2023","authors":"benjamin","tags":["release","buildbarn"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Buildbarn Block Sizes","permalink":"/blog/buildbarn-block-sizes"},"nextItem":{"title":"Bazel 6 Errors when using Build without the Bytes","permalink":"/blog/bazel-6-errors-build-without-the-bytes"}},"content":"The example configuration project for buildbarn\\n[bb-deployments](https://github.com/buildbarn/bb-deployments)\\nhas gotten updates.\\n\\nThis is a continuation of the\\n[updates from last year article](/blog/bb-deploy-updates-2022-04)\\nand is a high level summary of what has happened since April 2022 up to 2023-02-16.\\n\\n## Let ReferenceExpandingBlobAccess support GCS\\n\\nReferenceExpandingBlobAccess already supports S3 so support was extended to Google Cloud Storage buckets.\\n\\n## Support for prefetching Virtual Filesystems\\n\\nRunning workers with Fuse allows inputs for an action\\nto be downloaded on demand.\\nThis significantly reduces the amount of data\\nthat gets sent in order to run overspecified actions.\\nThis however leads to poor performance for actions\\nwhich reads a lot of their inputs synchronously.\\n\\nWith the prefetcher most of these actions can be recognized\\nand data which is likely to be needed\\ncan be downloaded ahead of time.\\n\\n## Support for sha256tree\\n\\nBuildbarn has added support for\\n[sha256tree](https://github.com/bazelbuild/remote-apis/pull/235)\\nwhich uses sha256 hashing over a tree structure similar to blake3.\\n\\nThis algorithm will allow large CAS objects to be chunked and decompositioned\\nwith guaranteed data integrity while still using sha256 hardware instructions.\\n\\n## Completeness checking now streams REv2 Tree objects\\n\\nThis change introduces a small change to the configuration schema.

analysis of what to build\\nBazel will ask the remote cache which items have already been built.\\nBazel will only schedule build actions for items\\nthat do not already exist in the cache.\\nIf running a build without the bytes[^1]\\nthe intermediary results will not be downloaded to the client.\\n\\nShould the cached items be evicted\\nthen Bazel will run into an unrecoverable error.\\nIt wants the remote system to perform an action using inputs from the cache,\\nbut they have disappeared.\\nAnd Bazel can not upload them,\\nas they were never downloaded to the client.\\nThe build would then dutifully crash\\n(some work has been put into trying to\\n[resolve this on the bazel side](https://groups.google.com/g/bazel-dev/c/WwNN4kiYSpc)\\nbut it has not been considered a priority).\\n\\nThis puts an implicit requirement on the remote cache implementation.\\nArtifacts need to be saved for as long as Bazel needs them.\\nThe problem here is that this is an undefined period of time.\\nBazel will not proactively check if the item still exists,\\nnor in any other manner inform the cache that\\nit will need the item in the future.\\n\\n## Before v6.0.0\\n\\nBazel tied the lifetime of which items already exists in the cache\\n(the existence cache)\\nto the analysis cache.\\nWhenever the analysis cache was purged it would also drop the existence cache.\\n\\nThe analysis cache is purged quite frequently.\\nIt would therefore be rare in practice,\\nthat the existence cache would be out of date.\\nFurthermore, since the existence cache was an in-memory cache,\\nBazel crashing would forcefully evict the existence cache.\\nThereby fixing the issue.\\n\\n## After v6.0.0\\n\\nWith the\\n`--experimental_action_cache_store_output_metadata` flag enabled by default\\nthe existence cache is instead committed to disk and\\nnever dropped during normal operation.\\n\\nThis means two things:\\n\\n1. The implied requirement on the remote cache is effectively infinite.\\n2. Should this requirement not be met the build will fail.\\n   And since the existence cache is committed to disk Bazel will just\\n   fail again the next time you run it.\\n\\nCurrently the only user-facing way of purging the existence cache\\nis to run `bazel clean`.\\nWhich is generally considered an anti-pattern.\\n\\nIf you are using the [bb-clientd](https://github.com/buildbarn/bb-clientd#-to-perform-remote-builds-without-the-bytes) `--remote_output_service`\\nto run builds without the bytes\\n(an alternative strategy to `--remote_download_minimal`)\\nthis will not affect you.\\n\\n[^1]:\\n    When using Bazel with remote execution\\n    remote builds are run in a remote server cluster.\\n    There is therefore no need for each developer\\n    to download the partial results of build.\\n    Bazel calls this feature\\n    [Remote Builds Without the Bytes](https://blog.bazel.build/2019/05/07/builds-without-bytes.html).\\n    The progress of the feature can be tracked at\\n    [GitHub](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6862)."},{"id":"buildbar-at-meroton-office","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/buildbar-at-meroton-office","editUrl":"https://github.com/meroton/docs/edit/main/blog/2022-11-24-build-bar-at-meroton-office.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2022-11-24-build-bar-at-meroton-office.mdx","title":"BuildBar at the Meroton Office","description":"After BazelCon we\'ve all gotten a bit giddy and you might feel excited how the information presented at BazelCon might impact your development workflow.","date":"2022-11-24T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 24, 2022","tags":[{"label":"meroton","permalink":"/blog/tags/meroton"},{"label":"afterwork","permalink":"/blog/tags/afterwork"}],"readingTime":0.57,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Benjamin Ingberg","imageURL":"/img/benjamin-avatar.png","key":"benjamin"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"buildbar-at-meroton-office","title":"BuildBar at the Meroton Office","authors":"benjamin","tags":["meroton","afterwork"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Bazel 6 Errors when using Build without the Bytes","permalink":"/blog/bazel-6-errors-build-without-the-bytes"},"nextItem":{"title":"Remote Executors for the Free Environment","permalink":"/blog/remote-executors-for-free-tier"}},"content":"After BazelCon we\'ve all gotten a bit giddy and you might feel excited how the information presented at BazelCon might impact your development workflow.\\nFor that purpose we\'re inviting everyone in the wider bazel community to an open BuildBar at the Meroton offices.\\n\\nCome over and digest BazelCon with high level technical discussions of the talks,\\ngreat company, a pleasant atmosphere and also beer.\\n\\nFeel welcome to come over this Thursday the first of December from 16 to 20.\\n\\n## Directions\\n\\nYou\'ll find us at our Link\xf6ping offices at Fridtunagatan 33.

Ideally your build actions should produce the same output when run with the same input, in practice this is sometimes not the case. If you are lucky a non-deterministic action won\'t be noticed since the inputs for the non-deterministic action is unchanged it won\'t be rebuilt.\\n\\nIf you\'re not so lucky the non-determinism stems from a bug in the implementation and you should definitiely pay attention to them.

The scheduling is done outside of your bazel invocation so your build throughput will be unaffected at the cost of an increase in the number of resources consumed.

As an aid for people to understand which changes have been done see the following high level summary.\\n\\n## April 2022 Updates\\n\\nThis includes updates to Buildbarn since December 2020.\\n\\n### Authorizer Overhaul\\n\\nAuthorizers have been rehauled to be more flexible it is now part of each individual cache and execution configuration.\\n\\nUsing a JWT authorization bearer token has been added as an authorization method.\\n\\n### Hierarchical Blob Access\\n\\nUsing hierarchical blob access allows blobs in instance name `foo/bar` to be accessed from instance `foo/bar/baz` but not instance `foo` or `foo/qux`.\\n\\n### Action Result Expiration\\n\\nAn expiry can be added to action result which lets the action cache purge the result of an exection that was performed too far in the past. This can be used to ensure that all targets are rebuilt periodically even if they are accessed frequently enough to not normally be purged from the cache.\\n\\n### Read Only Cache Replicas\\n\\nCache read traffic can now be sent to a read-only replica which is periodically probed for availability.\\n\\n### Concurrency Limiting Blob Replication\\n\\nLimit the number of concurrent replications to prevent network starvation\\n\\n### Run Commands as Another User\\n\\nAllows the commands to be run as a different user, on most platforms this means the bb-runner instance must run as root.\\n\\n### Size Class Analysis\\n\\nAllows executors of different size classes to be used, the scheduler will attempt to utilize executors efficiently but there is an inherent tradeof between throughput and latency. Once configured the scheduler will automatically attempt to keep track of which actions are best run on which executors.\\n\\n### Execution Routing Policy\\n\\nThe scheduler accepts an execution routing policy configuration that allows it to determine how to defer builds to different executors.\\n\\nIf you see any other changes you feel should get a mention feel free to submit a pull request at github using the link below."},{"id":"about","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/about","editUrl":"https://github.com/meroton/docs/edit/main/blog/2022-02-22-about.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2022-02-22-about.mdx","title":"Purpose of the Articles","description":"The purpose of these articles is to have a freeform area discussing ideas, technical issues, solutions and news in an indepth relaxed manner.
